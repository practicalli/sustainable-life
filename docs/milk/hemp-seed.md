# Hemp Seed Milk

Hemp is a great source of protein (20% ) and fat (omega 3, 6 and 9) and contains a full spectrum of amino acids which our bodies cannot produce.

The easiest milk to make as it requires almost no preparation and last for 2-3 days.

Arguably the most nutritional milk from a single source.


## Taste and Texture

Hemp seed milk has a creamy texture to it, somewhere between semi-skimmed and full-cream dairy milk.

There is very little taste to the hemp seed milk, especially after passed through a fine sieve.


## Recommended usage

Can be used for cereals as a direct replacement for milk.

Works well in sauces or as a creamy liquid to mix with dry ingredients when cooking or blending

<!-- TODO: is hemp-milk good for tea / coffee -->


## Preparation

Measure out quarter of a cup of hemp seeds per litre of water.

Rinse the hemp seeds to remove any dust from packaging.

Fill blender with 1 litre of water and rinsed hemp seeds.

Blend for 1-2 minute on high speed (depending on power of blender) - or until the top of the milk becomes very frothy.  The milk may become warm, but does not need to become hot.

Pour the milk into a suitable glass jar through a very fine sieve.

Place the glass jar of milk into the fridge to cool.  Or place is a cold location if too warm to place in the fridge.

> #### Hint::Rapidly cool milk
> Add a large ice cube to the milk to cool more rapidly and be able to place jar in the fridge sooner.
>
> During colder months, place the jar of milk outside to cool before placing in the fridge.
