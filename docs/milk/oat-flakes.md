# Oat Milk

Oats are a species of cereal grain high in beta-glucans which as part of a meal contributes to reduction of the blood glucose rise after a meal. An excellent source of Manganese which is good for metabolism, bones, connnective tissue and protects cells from oxidation

Milk from oats is very quick and simple to make, with no preparation required and should last 2.3 days when refrigerated in a air-tight container.


## Taste and Texture

Oat milk has a very creamy texture and can become very thick if with a high oat to water ratio.

Oat milk has a sweeter taste than other plant based milks (which tend to be more neutral or earthy).



## Recommended usage

Can be used for cereals as a direct replacement for milk.

Cooking with Oat milk will thicken the consistency considerably, so not a great choice thin sources such as Thai Green Curry (hemp milk is better)

Can be used as a thickener for sauces or as a creamy liquid to mix with dry ingredients when cooking or blending.

Oat milk is good for tea / coffee in small amounts, so long as the Oat milk has a low ratio of oats to water.

Measure out half a cup of Organic jumbo oats seeds per litre of water.

Fill blender with 1 litre of water and add the oats

Blend for up to 1 minute on high speed (depending on power of blender) - or until the top of the milk becomes very frothy.
