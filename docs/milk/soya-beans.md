# Soya Bean Milk

Soya beans are an excellent source of protein as well as Riboflavin (B2), Folate, Vitamin K, Magnesium, Potassium, Manganese, Iron & Copper.

Milk from soya beans requires some simple preparation and a little longer to blend as ideally it should become hot. Estimate about 15 minutes work.

Soya milk should last 2-3 days when refrigerated in a air-tight container.


## Taste and Texture

Soya milk has a slightly creamy texture and is close to very low fat dairy milk.

Milk made from the whole soya bean has a noticeable plant / earthy smell especially straight after blending.  The smell dissipates a little once cooled, although a subtle taste still remains.

If the smell of soya milk is unpalitable, try oat or hemp milk which do not have this taste.

> #### Hint::Commercial Soya milks remove natural smell
> Commercially made soya bean milk typically use only part of the soya bean, to reduce the natural smell and plant taste from the product.  Some manufacturers also pump in sugars or other sweeteners to mask the smell, so check the labels carefully before buying.  Typically a supermarkets own brand soya milk has fewer sweeteners and unnecessary ingredients (and is usually cheaper too).


## Recommended usage

Can be used for cereals as a direct replacement for milk.

Can be used in cooking and does not greatly change in consistency.  Not at binding as high-fat dairy milk (because it doesn't have the high animal fat)

Soya milk is okay for tea / coffee in small amounts although it may quickly separate and required stiring occasionally.


## Preparation

Soak half a full of soya beans in water overnight (or at least 4 hours).  This reduces the blending time required.

Fill blender with 1 litre of water and add the soaked soya beans (which should be at least 50% bigger now)

Blend for up to 4 minutes on high speed (depending on power of blender) or until the top of the milk becomes very frothy.  If your blender can tolerate high temperatures, then heat water in a kettle or hob to about 60 degrees Celsius (be careful when poring into the blender).

Using a fine sieve, pour the blended soya milk into a air-tight storage jar.

Place the glass jar of milk in a cold location until it is cool enough to place in the fridge.

> #### Hint::Cooling in colder months
> During colder months, place the jar of milk outside to cool before placing in the fridge.
