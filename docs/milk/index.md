# Home made milk

Home made milk is vastly more cost effective than store bought milk and also uses a lot less packaging and minimal transport costs (from the raw ingredients).

The most effective plant based milks are Hemp Seed, Oat and Soya Bean.  Practicalli recommends Hemp Seed milk, especially for breakfast cerials

## Storing Milk

Glass clip-top jars with airtight seals are an excellent container to store milk.

Kilner square glass jars are very useful for storing in the fridge as they do not role around on the shelf if layed sideways.


> #### Hint::Silicon replacement seals
> Glass jars typically come with rubber seals, which can degrade over time.  Replace with [silicon rings](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08N4XHMFP) for a far longer lasting and easier to clean seal.
