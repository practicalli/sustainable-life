## Local development

Zensical can be installed locally via vu or pip. Practicalli uses uv for simplicity.  Commands are wrapped in tasks defined within the `Makefile`.

Clone the repository and change into the root of the project.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/practicalli/cycling
```

Install Zensical as a tool using `uv` (updating if there is a new version).

```shell
make docs-install
```

Build the website and serve locally at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

```shell
make docs
```

---

Specific command if now using make:

Create a virtual python in the root of the project.

```shell
uv tool install zensical --upgrade
```
